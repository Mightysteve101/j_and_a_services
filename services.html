Using specialized equipment and proven techniques, we locate leaks with minimal disruption, then implement effective repair solutions. We understand that even small leaks can lead to significant problems over time, which is why we approach each detection job with thorough attention to detail. Our technicians employ multiple methods including pressure testing, dye testing, and electronic leak detection to pinpoint the exact location of leaks in your pool's shell, plumbing, or equipment. Once identified, we address the issue with appropriate repair techniques, whether that involves patching, pipe replacement, or equipment repairs. Our comprehensive approach ensures that we not only fix the immediate problem but also identify and address any underlying issues that could lead to future leaks.

                        Enhance your pool area with cool deck surfaces that remain comfortable underfoot even on New Mexico's hottest days. Our cool deck installations provide both practical benefits and aesthetic appeal, creating a safer and more enjoyable pool environment for your family and guests. Traditional concrete pool decking can reach uncomfortable and even dangerous temperatures during summer months, but cool deck technology reflects heat and stays significantly cooler to the touch. Our installation process includes thorough preparation of the existing surface, application of the specialized cool deck material, and careful finishing to create a uniform, attractive appearance. We offer various textures and color options to complement your home's exterior and landscape design while providing the functional benefit of reduced heat absorption. In addition to new installations, we also provide cool deck resurfacing for existing pool decks that need refreshing or repair, extending the life of your pool area while improving both safety and appearance.
